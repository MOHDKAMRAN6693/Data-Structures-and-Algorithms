# Basic Data Structures

This section covers the fundamental data structures that form the building blocks for more complex structures and algorithms.

## 📚 Topics Covered

1. **Arrays and Strings**
2. **Objects and Maps**
3. **Sets and Hash Tables**
4. **Basic Operations and Methods**

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will understand:
- How to work with arrays and strings effectively
- Object manipulation and property access
- Set operations and uniqueness
- Hash table concepts and implementation
- Time and space complexity of basic operations

## 📖 Contents

- [Arrays and Strings](./01-arrays-and-strings.js)
- [Objects and Maps](./02-objects-and-maps.js)
- [Sets and Hash Tables](./03-sets-and-hash-tables.js)
- [Basic Operations](./04-basic-operations.js)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Start with arrays and strings as they are the most fundamental data structures. Each file contains:
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Common operations and methods
- Performance analysis
- Practice exercises

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Practice regularly** - Implement each data structure from scratch
2. **Understand complexity** - Know the time/space complexity of operations
3. **Use built-in methods** - Learn JavaScript's native methods
4. **Compare approaches** - Understand when to use each structure
