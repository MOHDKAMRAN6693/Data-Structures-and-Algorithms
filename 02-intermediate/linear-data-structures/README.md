# Linear Data Structures

This section covers linear data structures that store elements in a sequential manner.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

1. **Stacks**
2. **Queues**
3. **Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)**
4. **Deques (Double-ended Queues)**

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this section, you will understand:
- How to implement stacks and queues
- How to work with different types of linked lists
- When to use each linear data structure
- Time and space complexity of operations
- Common algorithms using these structures

## ðŸ“– Contents

- [Stacks](./01-stacks.js)
- [Queues](./02-queues.js)
- [Singly Linked Lists](./03-singly-linked-lists.js)
- [Doubly Linked Lists](./04-doubly-linked-lists.js)
- [Circular Linked Lists](./05-circular-linked-lists.js)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Start with stacks as they are the simplest linear structure. Each file contains:
- Complete implementation from scratch
- Common operations and methods
- Real-world applications
- Practice problems

## ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success

1. **Implement from scratch** - Don't rely on built-in methods
2. **Understand the trade-offs** - Know when to use each structure
3. **Practice with problems** - Solve coding challenges
4. **Visualize operations** - Draw diagrams to understand

Let's build linear structures! ðŸ“š
